codefactory-control orchestrates AFU-9: autonomous code fabrication via AWS Lambda, Step Functions,
GitHub Actions and LLM-based patching. Use TypeScript for Lambdas, modular design, async/await,
no secrets in code, and strict alignment with the nine AFU-9 modules. Keep code production-ready
and consistent with the architecture.
