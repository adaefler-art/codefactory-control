# AFU-9 v0.4.0

AFU-9 v0.4 is a production-ready, operationally stable evolution of the AFU-9 autonomous code fabrication system, with a strong emphasis on deployment safety, health semantics, and documentation.

## Highlights

- Operational hardening for ECS/ALB health signaling (liveness vs readiness separation)
- Deployment safety guardrails and runbooks for predictable staging bring-up
- Canonical secret contract and validation expectations

## Documentation

- v0.4 Release Review & Reference State: docs/v04/V04_RELEASE_REVIEW.md
- v0.4 Staging Test Findings: docs/reviews/v0.4_staging_test_findings.md

## Notes

- Self-Propelling is explicitly deferred to v0.5 (non-blocking for v0.4).
