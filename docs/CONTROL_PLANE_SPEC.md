# AFU-9 Control Plane Specification (v1)

Status: Draft
Owner: AFU-9 / Codefactory

This document is the canonical entry point for the Control Plane contract:
- responsibilities
- APIs/endpoints
- lifecycle/status model
- guardrails and validation gates

Placeholder for v0.5: required by CI gate. Expand in v0.5 hardening epics.
